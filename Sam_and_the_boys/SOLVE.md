# Sam and the boys

## Challenge

`Sam used to work as a cyptographer for our Forensics & Cryptanalysis Wing, but he's now retired. He in a band now! And he can make some pretty cool tunes.. Check it out. But you know what they say, old habits die hard. Just keep an eye on him.
`
## Solution
When we listen to the given audio file, we hear beeps of varying durations somewhere along the middle of the song.
This is **Morse code**.
If only the Morse code was present in the file, we could've uploaded it to some online decryption site to get the result. But since there is a song playing in the background, we'll have to figure this one out ourselves.
