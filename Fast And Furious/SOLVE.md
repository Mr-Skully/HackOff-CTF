# Fast And  Furious

## Challenge prompt
```
Everthing went by so fast... How can I slow things down?
```

## **Solution**

First let's find out the type of file provided to us.
Using file <file> command we find out that the file is a 64 bit ELF.
We convert it into an executable(linux) using chmod and run the program.

![Fast_And_Furious](https://github.com/ajaysram/hackoff/blob/master/Fast_And_Furious/img/FastAndFurious1.png)

On running the executable, we find that first, we have to press enter and then before we can enter the password, we get an out of time message.
Lets now try strings command

Initial recon with strings
```
Press Enter and then type in your password as fast as you can..
Enter password:
IBelieveICanFly
How could you possibly get that wrong
Sorry, but you ran out of time...
```

This strings needs some attention, which seems to be our password.
```
IBelieveICanFly
```

Now how, can we make the program accept the input. Lets look at the code using some disassembler. I'll be using ida pro for the same.

Opening the executable using idda pro we get the following window.

Notice how the each block of the program is split into different boxes, to help us understand the control flow.
Now, look at the last line of the first box 

'''
jg	short loc_96D
'''

From here, we see 2 paths. Either to the left box, which accepts the password and compares it to 'IBelieveICanFly' or the right block which shows the 'out of time' message. Currently execution moves to the right, and we must change it to the left.
We can set a breakpoint to the last line of the first box, which now turns red as shown above.

Now run the debugger and select the option which continues execution of the program till the next wait. The terminal now shows us the follwing:

Press enter and return to the ida window. Now again run the program till the next wait. We can see that the execution has now stopped at the last line of the first box. The very same point we had set the breakpoint.

Here we can see the 2 arrows pointing to the next boxes. But the right arrow seems to be blinking, which tells us that, the control will now move to the right to execute the next instruction. This has to be changed. We need to go right.

Look at the rightmost column in the window. We can see some alphabets assigned some values. 

'''
ID	0
VIP	0
.
.
.
ZF	0
AF	0
PF	1
CF	0

'''

These are the registers and one of these decides the control flow in our case. In our case it is the ZF(Zero Flag). Double click on the '0' and you will get an input field with the value

'''
0x0
'''

Change it as follows:

![Fast_And_Furious](https://github.com/ajaysram/hackoff/blob/master/Fast_And_Furious/img/FastAndFurious5.png)

This changes XF to 1.

Now we can see the left arrow blinking. We have successfully changed the control flow.

Run the program till the next wait and your terminal window will show the follwing.

![Fast_And_Furious](https://github.com/ajaysram/hackoff/blob/master/Fast_And_Furious/img/FastAndFurious7.png)

Enter the password, press enter, return to ida and again run the program till the next wait.

![Fast_And_Furious](https://github.com/ajaysram/hackoff/blob/master/Fast_And_Furious/img/FastAndFurious8.png)

We got our flag.
